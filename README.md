This module is a reusable Terraform module that simplifies the creation and management of an EC2 key pair on AWS. This module creates an EC2 key pair and securely stores the private key in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SSM). The module also returns the key pair name and the SSM parameter ARN for later use in other resources, making it easy to reference the key pair in other parts of your infrastructure. Using this module can help you save time and effort in managing your key pairs while ensuring security and compliance in your AWS environment.

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "key_pair" {
  source = "squareops/keypair/aws"
  key_name           = "example-key"
  environment        = "production"
  ssm_parameter_path = "production-example-key"
}
```
Refer [this](https://github.com/squareops/terraform-aws-keypair/tree/main/examples) for more examples.


## Retrieve Private Key

To Retrieve the Private key from SSM:
```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --name "<ssm_parameter_path>" --region "<region>" --query Parameter.Value --output text
```

Additionally, to save the private key to a file:
```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --name "<ssm_parameter_path>" --region "<region>" --with-decryption --query Parameter.Value --output text > keypair.pem
```
